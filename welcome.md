# Machine Learning Notebooks

The main purpose of this application is to demonstrate the ability of Mercury framework to build Data Science course website with Jupyter notebooks.

We can make each tutorial as a Jupyter notebook and serve all tutorials as Jupyter notebooks in a single website using mercury framework.

This will be very useful for professors teaching Data Science as we can also add interactivity to each Jupyter notebook.

You can start this by doing pip install mljar-mercury

Find more about mercury here in the [official documentation](https://mercury-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

All the notebooks used in this application are taken from this repository [DAIR-AI/ML-Notebooks](https://github.com/dair-ai/ML-Notebooks)
