# Mercury web app to share ML notebooks
Mercury framework enables us to share jupyter notebooks without much efforts. All notebooks can be served in the form of a web application. 
It is very useful for professors teaching Data Science courses. We can make a jupyter notebook for each lesson and serve all jupyter notebooks as a web application.

All the notebooks in this repository are taken from [DAIR-AI/ML-Notebooks](https://github.com/dair-ai/ML-Notebooks).
These notebooks are modified by adding YAML config so that they can be served in the form of a web application.
Find the application here in this link [Mercury-ML Notebooks](https://mlnotebooks.herokuapp.com/)
